# Using docker-compose

We first build the container :

This example shows a simple way of running a small node js server listening on port 3000. WeÂ´re going to use docker compose for this test. Ve

```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run --service-ports echo
```

The above commands, will build the container and run the container (exposing the service ports). 

The configuration used to build and run the container can be found in `docker-compose.yml`.
